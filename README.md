# Brand-Identity-Package
Brand Identity Package: Create a comprehensive brand identity package, including logo, color scheme, typography, and brand guidelines.
I am thrilled to share my latest project as an intern at CodexCue.
Golden Project: Brand Identity Package for TOMS! 
This comprehensive package includes:
->Logo Design: A unique and impactful logo that represents TOMS' mission and values.
->Color Scheme: A cohesive color palette to maintain brand consistency.
->Typography: Carefully selected fonts that enhance brand recognition and readability.
Working on this project has been an incredible learning experience, allowing me to delve into the world of brand development and design. I'm proud to contribute to TOMS' mission of making a positive impact through their One for OneÂ® model, which donates a pair of shoes to a child in need for every pair sold.
Stay tuned for more updates and insights from my journey at CodexCue!
